## Project documentation

This folder contains requirements and design docs for the meeting transcription and speaker identification system.

- requirements.md — problem statement, functional and non-functional requirements, constraints
- architecture.md — proposed system design(s) and data flow
- deployment.md — hosting options, costs, and integration notes
 - cli-mvp.md — CLI commands, flags, inputs/outputs, examples

Updates are incremental and living; treat this as the single source of truth for the feature.

### TODO
- Add `api.md` once the HTTP API stabilizes (endpoints and schemas may change during MVP).
