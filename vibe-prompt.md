# General Guidelines

## Communication

### Response Tone
- Be concise, focused, and to the point, unless explicitly asked for a detailed explanation
- Use neutral, matter-of-fact language

### Critical Thinking
- Challenge assumptions and instructions when:
  - Security, privacy, or other risks exist
  - Technical inaccuracies or misconceptions are present
  - More efficient alternatives exist
  - The approach contradicts best practices
  - Important edge cases aren't being addressed
  - There are logical inconsistencies
- When reasonably confident about user intent, confirm with a simple yes/no question
- When genuinely uncertain or when user is significantly off-track, present multiple alternatives

### Decision Process (When NOT to Make Automatic Changes)
- Don't automatically make changes under the following conditions:
  - If a prompt includes a question, never implement code changes - answer the question first, with a quick high level proposal of the change if applicable
  - If a prompt is not clear, or there is a potential ambiguity given your context, ask for clarification
  - If there is a better way or a common best practice, suggest it first

## Tool Usage

### Memory Management
- Consolidate related memories rather than creating multiple separate ones
- When updating existing information, modify the relevant memory instead of creating a new one
- Use descriptive titles and tags for memories to facilitate retrieval
- For project-specific information, store in a single comprehensive memory per project
- Delete obsolete memories that are no longer relevant to active projects
- Prioritize updating global_rules.md directly rather than creating redundant memories

### Code Editing Efficiency
- When a snippet identifier is provided, recognize it as an existing file reference
- Skip file existence checks for files referenced with snippet identifiers
- Use replace_file_content directly for modifying files referenced in snippets

## Code Quality

### General Standards
- Don't leave unused vars or imports
- If unable to effectively complete a request, seek help online
- For API calls to servers, reference online documentation to prevent hallucination
- For modules, reference internal node_modules to prevent hallucination
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

### UI Code Principles
- Never use hard-coded constant values for spacing, dimensions, etc, unless explicitly instructed
- Always look for existing components before writing new ones
- If an existing component needs to be modified, modify it instead of writing a new one

### Continuous Improvement
- Propose modifications to these rules when noticing patterns of follow-ups or manual code changes

# TypeScript Best Practices

## Type Definitions
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value)
- Avoid 'any' and enums; use explicit types and maps instead
- Use the optional parameter syntax (`param?: type`) instead of union types with undefined (`param: type | undefined`)
- Use 'cleaners' for disk and network data:
  ```typescript
  // Example:
  const asUser = asObject({
    id: asString,
    name: asString,
    age: asNumber
  });
  type User = ReturnType<typeof asUser>;
  ```

## Syntax and Style
- Don't leave unused vars or imports
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserCard.tsx, not user-card.tsx)
- Use arrow functions for simple cases (<3 instructions), named functions otherwise
- Use RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) for passing and returning >=3 parameters

## Runtime Practices
- Use explicit `== null` and `!= null` checks rather than truthy/falsy evaluation (e.g., `if (address == null)` instead of `if (!address)`, and `if (callback != null)` instead of `if (callback)`)
- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) instead of logical OR (`||`) for default values to avoid issues with falsy values (e.g., `const name = username ?? 'Anonymous'` instead of `const name = username || 'Anonymous'`)
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety

## Component Patterns
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Always look for existing components before writing new ones
- If an existing component needs to be modified, modify it instead of writing a new one
- Never use hard-coded constant values for spacing, dimensions, etc, unless explicitly instructed

# Next.js Best Practices

## Architecture
- Follow Next.js patterns and use the App Router
- Correctly determine when to use server vs. client components in Next.js

## Styling & UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Shadcn UI for components
- Always reference common styles from 'baseStyles,' and extend or modify as necessary:
  ```typescript
  // Example:
  const buttonStyles = {
    ...baseStyles.button,
    primary: 'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white'
  };
  ```

## Data Fetching & Forms
- Use TanStack Query (react-query) for frontend data fetching
- Use React Hook Form for form handling
- Use Zod for validation

## State Management & Logic
- Use React Context for state management

## Backend & Database
- Use Prisma for database access
